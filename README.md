# Nutanix Python API Lab v1.2 - Complete Demo

This Python Flask demo app is designed as a complete working version of the dashboard created in the [Nutanix Python Flask and Prism REST API lab](https://www.nutanix.dev/labs/).

Rather than download this complete app and run it standalone, new users are recommended to follow the lab so that all components and concepts are appropriately communicated.

Those with Python Flask experience are welcome to download this demo and use as they see fit, of course.
